<p>In the spring semester of my sophomore year at GW, I wrote a magazine-style article about a New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group and their efforts to spread vital information about where the receive the first two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The group grew rapidly in size and became a place where people could share valuable information about such an important topic.</p>
<p>This article features various interviews with the creators and moderators of the group. Their insights provide a glimpse into the work and dedication of finding New Jersey citizens the resources to get the shot.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Not All Heroes Wear Capes</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic was a struggle for so many, taking shape in many forms: loved ones lost, plans turned upside down, futures in shambles, and anxieties through the roof. The state of New Jersey saw a total of approximately 871,333 COVID-19 cases and 22,904 deaths since the start in March 2020 (NJ Health). First glimpses of COVID-19 vaccinations were a symbol of hope; hope for the future and for a return to normalcy. States all across the country were confronted with the important task of managing vaccine rollout in their own communities. Rollout plans were strictly enforced by the federal government and managed by state governments, with each state determining different eligibility levels at different times. Vaccine distribution sites came in the form of chain and local pharmacies, popular venue areas, and hospital clinics. Yet there was another layer of this vaccination chaos: communication about where, when, who, and how could you receive the vaccine. Rightly so, doctors, nurses, and frontline workers are praised as heroes. At the same time, there are other heroes that deserve just as much praise. Because social media became people’s main source of contact during quarantine, sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram evolved into platforms where members of communities could have open discussions about vaccines. At least that is what Brandi, 27, and Brittany Prell, 33, of Bergen County, NJ believed and is ultimately what motivated them to create a group for New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Prell sisters got the idea to create the New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group when the pandemic changed their grandmother’s usual plan to spend half of the year in South Florida and in New Jersey. Instead of returning home to New Jersey in April 2020, their grandmother stayed in South Florida and the Prell sisters went the longest they’ve ever gone without seeing her. Brandi explained that after struggling to find a vaccine for their grandmother, Brittany turned to Facebook. Lo and behold, there was a South Florida Vaccine Info group that secured her grandmother a vaccine appointment within days. Brandi said this was the catalyst for creating a similar group for New Jersey. “We thought it would be 100-200 people of family and friends, but it just went crazy,” said Prell. The New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group now has approximately 137,540 members since they created it on January 15 2021 (Facebook).</p>
<p>The group is administered by both Brandi and Brittany Prell with around 25 moderators who monitor the group activity. Early on, both sisters agreed they could not handle this group on their own. The Prells initially selected a few moderators, members who showed the most frequent activity. “From there, more people wanted to help, so that’s how all of our moderators came to be,” mentioned Brandi Prell. She said that most members of the group joined with the goal of securing a vaccine appointment. Sandy Thompson, 37, is a resident of Morris County who, like most, heard about the group by word of mouth when she wanted to find appointments for her aunt. She recalls that after booking the appointment about a week later, she stayed in the group as a member and “got caught up in it all.” Thompson speaks for many explaining, “you book one person and all of a sudden you’re getting requests for another 10 to 15 within a matter of a few hours.” After her active role in the group, the admins asked her to become a moderator.</p>
<p>Not all members came to the group just to find appointments. Abby Cardinale, 32, a moderator from Central Jersey participated in a Pfizer vaccination trial in early October 2020. Cardinale explained how her interest in knowing more about the COVID-19 vaccine prompted her to join the trial. “I was pretty sure I got the real thing from the side-effects. I had the response that was on the more obvious side of things,” said Cardinale. She immediately joined a Facebook group for trial participants as a way to share information between those in very similar situations about experiences undergoing the trial; a “precursor” group to the New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info group. Cardinale wasn’t the only one with this story. Casey Chandler, 60, of Union County, NJ is a current member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. Just like Cardinale, she got involved after joining a vaccine trial for Johnson and Johnson. Chandler heard about this opportunity from none other than a Facebook advertisement. The J and J trial began for Chandler in March 2021. She received her first shot for the trial just one day before she became eligible for the real vaccine. When J and J told Chandler she could drop out of the trial and get the real deal shot, she declined because she felt that the trial was too important to give up. The trial motivated Chandler to become a member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group.</p>
<p>Over the last month, the group saw a total of 7,365 posts. In just one day, the group typically sees up to 100 or more posts (Facebook). Posts consist of anything ranging from asking for assistance in booking an appointment to questions about when certain pharmacies open availability for vaccines. Evie Jackman Davis, 72, is a member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group from Rockland County, NY. She learned about the NJ vaccine appointment system when she began searching for appointments for her son and daughter-in-law. For a long period of time, CVS dropped large numbers of appointments around 4:30am each day. CVS switched the appointment drop to the “more civilized” time of midnight each night. When appointments are released, spots fill up immediately, so timing is critical.</p>
<p>Members quickly learned a trick to work around this issue. “It was a back door way to get into the site,” said Davis as she described the strategic way to get an appointment. “You couldn’t just click on New Jersey because it would always say no appointments were available, but if you went in through some other obscure state like Louisiana, they were always available,” explained Davis. Once reaching this step, the site asks for the state once again. Now entering New Jersey and a specific zip code would open up hundreds of appointments to select. According to Davis, this method was by far the easiest way to book an appointment. Those who knew this type of information, like Davis, were blasting it in posts to the Facebook group, helping hundreds of thousands make appointments.</p>
<p>Davis pointed out that in her home state of New York the process is significantly easier compared to New Jersey. New York has a one-stop-shop website made by the state that people can use to look for appointments. New Jersey doesn’t have anything like that and it is much more fragmented, making it harder to navigate. In New Jersey, a resident has to live in a certain county to make their appointment. New York is clearly a different story despite the proximity of both states. “You don’t have to live in Rockland County. All you need is to have New York state residency and be qualified. In New Jersey, I’m just not finding that,” commented Davis. She emphasized that due to these circumstances, the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group was crucial because it modeled that one-stop-shop site from New York. It was a place where anyone could ask for information, and within minutes a member would respond to help.</p>
<p>A group of this size is hard to control with just two administrators and 25 moderators. Rules and regulations must be enforced and followed in order to avoid uncontrollable comment threads and posts that are irrelevant to the main goal of the group. Christine Shenkman, 43, from Ocean County is another moderator for the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. Shenkman shared her experience with another Facebook group she had been a member of with very similar goals of booking appointments and vaccine announcements in NJ. According to Shenkman, the group didn’t have “nearly the overall structure” of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. She left the group because of unnecessary drama and a lack of control. Shenkman thinks the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group’s intent should be “keep the riff-raff to a minimum, keep the politics out, and talk solely about direct access and support.” She came to this conclusion after memes were carelessly posted in the early stages of the group. “We had to immediately reel that in because you’d have some of the elder community write back saying ‘you think death is funny?’ and get very angry,” recalled Shenkman as she reported on the backlash received by many members. This era of the group was short-lived, as Shenkman, Prell, and others set some guidelines for group material, sticking to the main goal of having a “central location of information.” (Prell)</p>
<p>A quick search won’t find any groups for those against the vaccine in NJ. This doesn’t mean there aren’t people with those values in the state. The New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice is a group that advocates against mandatory vaccinations. While the COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory, the coalition’s website does include an entire section about the COVID-19 vaccine. Here, the coalition provides links to statistics on vaccine deaths, updates on the enforcement of the vaccine from different businesses, and more.</p>
<p>Likewise, New Jersey gym owner Ian Smith from The Atilis Gym in Bellmawr tweeted in March 2021 that the gym would be giving out free memberships to those who didn’t get vaccinated. In his tweet, Smith wrote, “we believe in health - the real way - exercise, good diet, plenty of Vitamin D, Zinc, and an environment to destress.” (Twitter). The same gym was previously fined over $1.2 million for violating COVID-19 lockdown orders (NY Post).</p>
<p>It is apparent that the members and moderators of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group all support the vaccine. After all, the group wouldn’t exist if they did not. Everyone has a different story and connection to the virus, yet all members share the same mentality on the vaccine. Chandler, for example, has a 27-year-old son in a nursing home because he is both mentally and physically disabled. He contracted COVID-19 twice, fortunately recovered, and is now fully vaccinated by his nursing home. “[The vaccine] is going to lead us out of what has been a nightmarish 13 months,” commented Chandler.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 3,054,030 fully vaccinated people (NJ Health). Many moderators are parents and believe the vaccine is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of their children and family. “I got vaccinated because my child can’t. I’m going to do whatever I can to keep them safe and to get them back to their normalcy,” said Thompson. Cardinale added “until we can protect them directly, it is our responsibility to protect everybody indirectly as well.” Prell offered her input detailing her job as a teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing in NYC. “One person can make a difference, so if everyone can just get a shot, that can stop it for so many people,” Prell communicated.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to keep track of just how many appointments have resulted from the group’s efforts. There are simply too many to count. Davis explained that while she has only made around 50 appointments, there are other members making over hundreds of appointments. “It’s all they do, day and night,” she notes. “For the first time in a year, I didn’t feel like a victim. I didn’t feel helpless. I felt like we were fighting back and that we could win.” This is how she described the group as a whole. According to Davis, people would stay up all night long helping “total strangers” find appointments. No one is receiving paid compensation for the work that they do, even though they deserve it. People spend their entire work days hunting for vaccines not just for themselves, but for others. The group is a “godsend,” according to Davis.</p>
<p>When asked the question, “if you could describe this Facebook group in one word, what would it be?”, admin of the group, Prell firmly stated, “helpful.” The moderators answered with words like “empowering,” “incredible,” and “life-saving.” What do all of these words have in common? They are all words used to describe heroes, and this group is filled with them.</p>
