|======================================================================| 100%\n\n\nNext, let’s map out the polygons of the Georgia counties.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(counties_geo) + \n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, it looks like we should be good to go. Use the newly created map data in counties_geo along with our election results datasets to complete the questions below.\n7)\nFor the Senate race, create a choropleth (shaded) map of Georgia counties that shows where the Republican candidate for Senate did better vs. worse than Trump.\n\n\nCode\nsenatemap <- inner_join(counties_geo, senate_results, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(senatemap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"is_r_above_trump\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\n\n8)\nNow do the same as Question 7, just this time do it for the race for Governor.\n\n\nCode\ngovmap <- inner_join(counties_geo, governor_results, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(govmap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"is_r_above_trump\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\n\n9)\nFor the Senate race, create a choropleth map that shows the margins of victory for the Democratic candidate. To do that you’ll need to compare the Democratic candidate’s percentage (pct_d_2022) with the Republican’s (pct_r_2022) to calculate the margin of victory for each county.\n\n\nCode\nMOV_senatemap <- inner_join(counties_geo, MOV_data_senate, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(MOV_senatemap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"MOV\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\nVariable(s) \"MOV\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n10)\nNow do the same as Question 4, only this time for the race for Governor instead.\n\n\nCode\nMOV_govmap <- inner_join(counties_geo, MOV_data_governor, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(MOV_govmap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"MOV_gov\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\nVariable(s) \"MOV_gov\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n11)\nExtra credit: determine the biggest differences between what the Republican candidate for Governor received and what the Senate candidate received. Then create a choropleth map of Georgia counties that shows those differences.\n(Note that to accomplish this you’ll have to first run a join that merges the two datasets, so that you have both the senate and governor version of the pct_r_2022 column in the same table.)"
