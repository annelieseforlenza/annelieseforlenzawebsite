    "text": "This paper analyzes The Help and it’s interaction with politics and surveillance, bringing in various pieces of previous film analysis literature as backing to the arguments.\n\nMothers and Maids in Mississippi:\nA Scholarly Investigation of Surveillance and Discipline in The Help\nIn many societies, politics submits itself to the private sphere when surveillance and the watchful gaze exerts power over its subject. Further, by the phrase ‘private sphere’, it is merely the fact that surveillance over the individual is arguably only in their sphere of knowledge, their own internal spaces causing the individual to become disciplined. It can be thought of, also, that this discipline can be indirectly racist. There seems to be no escape from the discriminatory, normalized behavior that is embedded in this gaze. The film The Help reveals this problem. In Jackson, Mississippi circa 1963, recent graduate and aspiring journalist, Skeeter, has intentions of revealing the real lifestyle of African American maids for southern housewives. I will be arguing that the actions of society in the Jim Crow South act as a surveilling gaze and contribute to an internal discipline of the characters seen in the film. This essay will reveal that due to political life in the 1960s Jim Crow era being focused privately, on the individual, and due to the fact that the racist actions of the South embody a watchful gaze and prove to be a surveilling villain, it takes certain characters to act out with strength and resilience to overcome this political problem. With Foucault’s reasoning in The Foucault Reader, The Help provides a critique of his arguments by revealing the absence of intentional racial discipline and in combination with Anker’s explanation of a racially driven melodrama in Orgies of Feeling, The Help upholds her reality of purposeful racism through the use of melodramatic elements and roles.\nPolitical life in the 1960s Jim Crow era extends all the way into the individual, specifically highlighted in The Help and their personal sphere. Segregation in the South was normal and to be inherently racist was fitting, for most. Throughout the film, looking through a melodramatic lens, it is brought to attention that the black race and in specific, the two main maids, Aibileen and Minny are deemed the villain and the cause of all that is wrong with society. This is clearly highlighted through the actions and reactions of Hilly, the main housewife. For instance, during their ladies luncheon, Hilly refuses to go to the bathroom because Aibileen uses it as well. She explains, “They carry different diseases than we do”. Hilly and the rest of her possy claim the role of the victim, when in reality they are the villain. Even clearer and more dramatic is the scene in which Minny desperately expresses her need to use the bathroom due to a dangerous storm outside. Despite Hilly’s discontent, Minny uses it anyways and is fired on the spot. These housewives in Jackson represent a clearly racialized society. In her book Orgies of Feeling, author Anker writes about how the roles of the victim and villain can be racialized. She states, “The national identity constructed out of melodrama can thus elide the unequal realms of freedom as they are lived in the daily particulars of American lives marked by economic disempowerment, racialized exploitation, and unequal access to power” (Anker 87). In addition to a discriminatory and therefore problematic setting in The Help, the society extends to the individual and their personal life as well. For instance, this is seen in the life of Aibileen. When she sits down with Skeeter to be interviewed for the story, she explains how this lifestyle and being a black woman in Mississippi caused the death of her son. Aibileen remarks, “Anniversary of his death: Every year I can’t breathe. But to y’all it’s just another day of bridge. If you stop [writing] this, everything he was gonna die with him”. The gaze roots itself within the individual on a personal level, affecting their actions and emotions, as seen in the film. Similarly, the majority of the scenes from The Help are located in households: bedrooms, kitchens, backyards, and dining rooms. Furthermore, this deliberacy could arguably be a reflection of the notion of racism in the private sphere of individuals. This metaphorical aspect of the film enhances the point to its full capacity. The household setting is meant to direct the gaze and surveillance into the characters’ personal lives.\nWith the notion that in The Help, politics are indirectly forced upon individuals and their private lives, it can be advanced further to point out that the discriminatory and normalized actions in Mississippi embody a watchful gaze that disciplines it’s subjects. In his book, The Foucault Reader, philosopher Michael Foucault posits, “Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects a principle of compulsory visibility… Their visibility assures the hold of the power that is exercised over them (Foucault 199). Often times, the subjects aren’t aware that the gaze and therefore discipline is even there. It becomes”normalized”. This is true in The Help through the behavior of Hilly and the other wives. However, Foucault’s reasoning can be critiqued in so far that he excludes the role that racism and discrimination can play in this scenario. He writes, “The perpetual penalty that traverses all points and supervises every instant in the disciplinary institutions compares, differentiates, hierarchizes, homogenizes, excludes. In short, it normalizes” (195). On the one hand, Foucault’s thought is synonymous with the film. But, on the other hand, he disregards the fact that the differentiation, hierarchy, and exclusion can have negative connotations and implications as seen in the film. Moreover, the dominating, overseeing gaze is problematic when it gets to be controlled by racist masses that inherently discipline its [white] subjects to think in a discriminatory way. Also, it becomes problematic when it disciplines it’s black subjects to think that they are always inferior to the white race. Perhaps Foucault was sincerely not aware and therefore didn’t mention race’s role in his argument. But, for the sake of this paper, it is important to highlight its importance and problematic implications. The film makes it very clear that this type of discipline infests itself in its variety of subjects. For instance, as Minny and her daughter walk to work, she lists off everything she must do as a young maid. Minny exclaims, “You cooking white food? You taste it with a different spoon. When you serving white folks coffee, put it down in front of them, don’t hand it to them cause your hands can’t touch”. It is the power of the society that is causing Minny to think and act in this way. As Foucault puts it, “In short, this power is exercised rather than possessed; it is not the”priviledge,” acquired or preserved, of the dominant class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions–an effect that is manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those who are dominated” (174). Another prime example in the film that displays this type of discipline reversely is in the scene in which Hilly’s maid, Yule Mae politely asks Hilly and her husband to help cover a small part of tuition for her son. She explains she would take more pay as a loan and work it off overtime. Immediately after asking, Hilly’s husband says as he fakes to check his watch, “I am late. I gotta get going” and leaves the house. Afterwards, Hilly denies Yule the money and blames it on her being a “good Christian”. In theory, it is the same watchful force exerting power over both Hilly and Minny in these situations but they are under different disciplines under a racist lens. Nonetheless, these two types are extremely prevalent in The Help and cause a large, ethical problem.\nFoucault states, “But the body is also directly involved in a political field; power relations have an immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, train it, torture it… to emit signs” (Foucault 173). Arguably, this power exerts itself on racialized subjects. In response to a racially flawed gaze and power, certain people, arguably coined ‘heros’ stand out and act against the inherent discipline to follow the norm. Anker argues that melodrama often combines the victim with the hero. And although the roles of the victim, villain, and hero are switched around, this phenomenon is reflected in the ending scene of the film. In the end, the story makes the audience feel as though Aibileen, Minny, and Skeeter are originally victimized but in the end, are meant to be seen as heroes, defeating the racism in their own respects. For one, Skeeter embodies the “outcast” in the film as she is consciously aware of the blatant racism going on in her midst. Moreover, she is seemingly the only one who recognizes it. This gives her willingness to write a book on all of the maid’s experiences, the good and the bad. She compiles all of them in a book title The Help. Skeeter must be pointed out as a hero of the film due to her bravery to publish something so taboo for its time. An example of this is in the luncheon scene. Hilly is explaining how there must be a separate bathroom for the colored help. The film angles of this scene in particular and the expressions of Skeeter reveals her growing discontent with this society. As a response, Skeeter answers, “Maybe we should just build you a bathroom outside”. Skeeter also reveals her unique and arguably heroic personality when she explains to Aibileen and Minny the purpose of her writing The Help. She says, “I want to show her perspective, so people might understand what it’s like from your side”. Perhaps Skeeter’s background of having a maid, Constantine, who assumed the role of her mother contributes to the motivations of her character. But, nonetheless, Skeeter exemplifies a hero in The Help and confirms Anker’s expression of melodramatic roles. Additionally, in the closing scene, Aibileen returns to her white family and finds Hilly accusing her of stealing pieces of silver. Though she didn’t touch it, Hilly and Elizabeth (mother that Aibileen works for) place the blame on her and she is unjustly fired on the spot with threats of calling the police. Aibileen works up the nerve to stand up for herself against Hilly. Angrily yet powerful, she says, “All you do is scare and lie to get what you want. You’re a godless woman. Ain’t you tired Miss Hilly?”. Aibileen’s character represents someone willing to stand up against the racist masses, led by Hilly in the film. In this scene, she is solving this political problem of racially driven surveillance and discipline and the consequential inequality and violence that comes with it. The film ends with her walking away from her white family. She quotes, “No one had ever asked me what it feels like to be me. Once I told the truth about that, I felt free”. Aibileen demonstrates a victim turned hero; a hero for herself and for every person who has been in the situation she had been in; a hero that society needed, even though it believed otherwise. Perhaps breaking free to regain the political power that was once taken away or arguably never given, is the way in which people solve this problem both personally and socially.\nIn conclusion, the goal of this essay was to reveal the problem that political power is often exerted on subjects in the private sphere and in many instances, pose racist sexist threats to their selective subjects specifically seen in The Help. Furthermore, the power is often exerted by a ‘watchful gaze’, known as society of the Jim Crow South as its subjects are surveilled through a racist lens and in turn, creates an inherent discipline within the people. Power exerted through the private sphere simply refers to the gaze over an individual’s personal lives. This creates a problem that can be arguably solved/responded to by the right subject. And, in the case of The Help, it is with the actions of Skeeter, Minny, and Aibileen on the discrimination in Jackson, Mississppi circa 1963. Through highlighting Anker’s argument of race in melodrama as well as critiquing Foucault’s idea of surveillance and discipline, these three components of the overall political problem are brought together in partnership with The Help."

    "text": "This article features various interviews with the creators and moderators of the group. Their insights provide a glimpse into the work and dedication of finding New Jersey citizens the resources to get the shot.\n\nNot All Heroes Wear Capes\nThe pandemic was a struggle for so many, taking shape in many forms: loved ones lost, plans turned upside down, futures in shambles, and anxieties through the roof. The state of New Jersey saw a total of approximately 871,333 COVID-19 cases and 22,904 deaths since the start in March 2020 (NJ Health). First glimpses of COVID-19 vaccinations were a symbol of hope; hope for the future and for a return to normalcy. States all across the country were confronted with the important task of managing vaccine rollout in their own communities. Rollout plans were strictly enforced by the federal government and managed by state governments, with each state determining different eligibility levels at different times. Vaccine distribution sites came in the form of chain and local pharmacies, popular venue areas, and hospital clinics. Yet there was another layer of this vaccination chaos: communication about where, when, who, and how could you receive the vaccine. Rightly so, doctors, nurses, and frontline workers are praised as heroes. At the same time, there are other heroes that deserve just as much praise. Because social media became people’s main source of contact during quarantine, sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram evolved into platforms where members of communities could have open discussions about vaccines. At least that is what Brandi, 27, and Brittany Prell, 33, of Bergen County, NJ believed and is ultimately what motivated them to create a group for New Jersey.\nThe Prell sisters got the idea to create the New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group when the pandemic changed their grandmother’s usual plan to spend half of the year in South Florida and in New Jersey. Instead of returning home to New Jersey in April 2020, their grandmother stayed in South Florida and the Prell sisters went the longest they’ve ever gone without seeing her. Brandi explained that after struggling to find a vaccine for their grandmother, Brittany turned to Facebook. Lo and behold, there was a South Florida Vaccine Info group that secured her grandmother a vaccine appointment within days. Brandi said this was the catalyst for creating a similar group for New Jersey. “We thought it would be 100-200 people of family and friends, but it just went crazy,” said Prell. The New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group now has approximately 137,540 members since they created it on January 15 2021 (Facebook).\nThe group is administered by both Brandi and Brittany Prell with around 25 moderators who monitor the group activity. Early on, both sisters agreed they could not handle this group on their own. The Prells initially selected a few moderators, members who showed the most frequent activity. “From there, more people wanted to help, so that’s how all of our moderators came to be,” mentioned Brandi Prell. She said that most members of the group joined with the goal of securing a vaccine appointment. Sandy Thompson, 37, is a resident of Morris County who, like most, heard about the group by word of mouth when she wanted to find appointments for her aunt. She recalls that after booking the appointment about a week later, she stayed in the group as a member and “got caught up in it all.” Thompson speaks for many explaining, “you book one person and all of a sudden you’re getting requests for another 10 to 15 within a matter of a few hours.” After her active role in the group, the admins asked her to become a moderator.\nNot all members came to the group just to find appointments. Abby Cardinale, 32, a moderator from Central Jersey participated in a Pfizer vaccination trial in early October 2020. Cardinale explained how her interest in knowing more about the COVID-19 vaccine prompted her to join the trial. “I was pretty sure I got the real thing from the side-effects. I had the response that was on the more obvious side of things,” said Cardinale. She immediately joined a Facebook group for trial participants as a way to share information between those in very similar situations about experiences undergoing the trial; a “precursor” group to the New Jersey Covid Vaccine Info group. Cardinale wasn’t the only one with this story. Casey Chandler, 60, of Union County, NJ is a current member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. Just like Cardinale, she got involved after joining a vaccine trial for Johnson and Johnson. Chandler heard about this opportunity from none other than a Facebook advertisement. The J and J trial began for Chandler in March 2021. She received her first shot for the trial just one day before she became eligible for the real vaccine. When J and J told Chandler she could drop out of the trial and get the real deal shot, she declined because she felt that the trial was too important to give up. The trial motivated Chandler to become a member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group.\nOver the last month, the group saw a total of 7,365 posts. In just one day, the group typically sees up to 100 or more posts (Facebook). Posts consist of anything ranging from asking for assistance in booking an appointment to questions about when certain pharmacies open availability for vaccines. Evie Jackman Davis, 72, is a member of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group from Rockland County, NY. She learned about the NJ vaccine appointment system when she began searching for appointments for her son and daughter-in-law. For a long period of time, CVS dropped large numbers of appointments around 4:30am each day. CVS switched the appointment drop to the “more civilized” time of midnight each night. When appointments are released, spots fill up immediately, so timing is critical.\nMembers quickly learned a trick to work around this issue. “It was a back door way to get into the site,” said Davis as she described the strategic way to get an appointment. “You couldn’t just click on New Jersey because it would always say no appointments were available, but if you went in through some other obscure state like Louisiana, they were always available,” explained Davis. Once reaching this step, the site asks for the state once again. Now entering New Jersey and a specific zip code would open up hundreds of appointments to select. According to Davis, this method was by far the easiest way to book an appointment. Those who knew this type of information, like Davis, were blasting it in posts to the Facebook group, helping hundreds of thousands make appointments.\nDavis pointed out that in her home state of New York the process is significantly easier compared to New Jersey. New York has a one-stop-shop website made by the state that people can use to look for appointments. New Jersey doesn’t have anything like that and it is much more fragmented, making it harder to navigate. In New Jersey, a resident has to live in a certain county to make their appointment. New York is clearly a different story despite the proximity of both states. “You don’t have to live in Rockland County. All you need is to have New York state residency and be qualified. In New Jersey, I’m just not finding that,” commented Davis. She emphasized that due to these circumstances, the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group was crucial because it modeled that one-stop-shop site from New York. It was a place where anyone could ask for information, and within minutes a member would respond to help.\nA group of this size is hard to control with just two administrators and 25 moderators. Rules and regulations must be enforced and followed in order to avoid uncontrollable comment threads and posts that are irrelevant to the main goal of the group. Christine Shenkman, 43, from Ocean County is another moderator for the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. Shenkman shared her experience with another Facebook group she had been a member of with very similar goals of booking appointments and vaccine announcements in NJ. According to Shenkman, the group didn’t have “nearly the overall structure” of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group. She left the group because of unnecessary drama and a lack of control. Shenkman thinks the NJ Covid Vaccine Info group’s intent should be “keep the riff-raff to a minimum, keep the politics out, and talk solely about direct access and support.” She came to this conclusion after memes were carelessly posted in the early stages of the group. “We had to immediately reel that in because you’d have some of the elder community write back saying ‘you think death is funny?’ and get very angry,” recalled Shenkman as she reported on the backlash received by many members. This era of the group was short-lived, as Shenkman, Prell, and others set some guidelines for group material, sticking to the main goal of having a “central location of information.” (Prell)\nA quick search won’t find any groups for those against the vaccine in NJ. This doesn’t mean there aren’t people with those values in the state. The New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice is a group that advocates against mandatory vaccinations. While the COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory, the coalition’s website does include an entire section about the COVID-19 vaccine. Here, the coalition provides links to statistics on vaccine deaths, updates on the enforcement of the vaccine from different businesses, and more.\nLikewise, New Jersey gym owner Ian Smith from The Atilis Gym in Bellmawr tweeted in March 2021 that the gym would be giving out free memberships to those who didn’t get vaccinated. In his tweet, Smith wrote, “we believe in health - the real way - exercise, good diet, plenty of Vitamin D, Zinc, and an environment to destress.” (Twitter). The same gym was previously fined over $1.2 million for violating COVID-19 lockdown orders (NY Post).\nIt is apparent that the members and moderators of the NJ Covid Vaccine Info Facebook group all support the vaccine. After all, the group wouldn’t exist if they did not. Everyone has a different story and connection to the virus, yet all members share the same mentality on the vaccine. Chandler, for example, has a 27-year-old son in a nursing home because he is both mentally and physically disabled. He contracted COVID-19 twice, fortunately recovered, and is now fully vaccinated by his nursing home. “[The vaccine] is going to lead us out of what has been a nightmarish 13 months,” commented Chandler.\nCurrently, there are 3,054,030 fully vaccinated people (NJ Health). Many moderators are parents and believe the vaccine is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of their children and family. “I got vaccinated because my child can’t. I’m going to do whatever I can to keep them safe and to get them back to their normalcy,” said Thompson. Cardinale added “until we can protect them directly, it is our responsibility to protect everybody indirectly as well.” Prell offered her input detailing her job as a teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing in NYC. “One person can make a difference, so if everyone can just get a shot, that can stop it for so many people,” Prell communicated.\nIt is extremely difficult to keep track of just how many appointments have resulted from the group’s efforts. There are simply too many to count. Davis explained that while she has only made around 50 appointments, there are other members making over hundreds of appointments. “It’s all they do, day and night,” she notes. “For the first time in a year, I didn’t feel like a victim. I didn’t feel helpless. I felt like we were fighting back and that we could win.” This is how she described the group as a whole. According to Davis, people would stay up all night long helping “total strangers” find appointments. No one is receiving paid compensation for the work that they do, even though they deserve it. People spend their entire work days hunting for vaccines not just for themselves, but for others. The group is a “godsend,” according to Davis.\nWhen asked the question, “if you could describe this Facebook group in one word, what would it be?”, admin of the group, Prell firmly stated, “helpful.” The moderators answered with words like “empowering,” “incredible,” and “life-saving.” What do all of these words have in common? They are all words used to describe heroes, and this group is filled with them."
